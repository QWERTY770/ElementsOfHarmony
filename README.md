One day, **Steve** is busy crafting, he was happy about what he found: tons of diamond ores! (Amazing)

Just when he wanted to dig deeper and get more, he found a very strange ore.

It is odd indeed, for it's darker than any ore he had seen before.

He tried to craft it with his iron pickaxe, but failed: it's so hard!

He returned into his house and bring a diamond pickaxe, again he tried, and this time, he got a... very common ore.

What is it? Steve felt very curious, he smelt it and got an ingot.

Just when he took this ingot into his item stack, he felt a dizzy sensation, and suddenly, the recipes of how to use these ingots popped into his mind.

He sat down and start building, and soon he left the Overworld, to... a place which nobody knows till now...
